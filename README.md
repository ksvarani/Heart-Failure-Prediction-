# Heart-Failure-prediction-using-ANN

Heart failure is a severe medical condition that affects millions of people especially adults and old age people. It is a chronic condition that develops gradually over time and can lead to serious complications such as hospitalization and death. Early and accurate diagnosis of heart failure is critical to improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been increasingly used to predict heart failure due to their ability to learn complex relationships between inputs and outputs. ANNs can process large amounts of data and identify patterns that may not be obvious to humans. In heart failure prediction using ANNs, clinical data is collected and preprocessed to normalize and scale the data. The ANN is then trained using the preprocessed data to learn the relationship between the inputs and the target output.

The architecture for the heart failure prediction using ANN, based on the code and details provided, consists of a Sequential model with multiple Dense layers.
